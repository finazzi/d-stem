In order to run a demo please follow these steps:

1) Open MATLAB;
2) Select a demo folder between DCM, HDGM or f-HDGM;
2) Open and run the demo_*.m script;
3) Choose an option from the menu.

Please note that:

a) The following MATLAB toolboxes are required:
   - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
   - Optimization Toolbox
   - Mapping Toolbox
   - Parallel Computing Toolbox 

b) The Mapping Toolbox is only required for plotting maps while it is not requires for model estimation

c) The Parallel Computing Toolbox is only needed to exploit the parallel capabilities of D-STEM

d) The code has been developed and tested on MATLAB R2019a
